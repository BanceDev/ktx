KTX: a Quakeworld&trade; server mod
===

[KTX] is a popular **Quakeworld&trade;** server modification, adding numerous features to the core features of the server.

Although it had been developed to be **QuakeworldQuakeworld&trade;** server agnostic, it has over the years been developed very close to [MVDSV] to which it has become an extent, thus compatibility with other **Quakeworldâ„¢** servers might not have been maintained.
